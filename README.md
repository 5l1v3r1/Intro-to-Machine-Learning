## Courses

- Fast AI (http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lessons.html). If you do not have a few weeks/months to spend on machine learning, you should audit this course. It will get you started in applied machine learning. 
- Machine Learning by Andrew NG (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This is perhaps the best introductory course for machine learning. If you have around 1-2 months, you should take this course.
